In the course of development of the AS-206 computer program at MIT, a  
coding error was discovered which was immediately recognized as being  
common to the AS-204 and AS-501/502 programs. It is a scaling error,  
if you know what that means, which imposes the operational constraint  
of not operating one of the integration programs (i.e., Average G) at  
an altitude in excess of about 3,000 n.mi. Whereas this should pose  
no problem on AS-204, we have some concern about AS-501 and AS-502.  
Specifically, during the nominal mission, the Average G program is set  
into operation when the spacecraft is at an altitude of approximately  
2,500 n.mi. Errors in the state vector update sent prior to the previous  
maneuver which places the spacecraft in this high altitude trajectory,  
or failure to get that update into the spacecraft computer  
for some reason, could result in dispersiosn wherein the Average G  
would be called upon at an altitude above the 3,000 n.mi. limit. Of  
course the guidance system would not recognized it was at the higher  
altitude except that a second state vector update is transmitted just  
before Average G is turned on in order to proide acceptable reentry  
conditions and landing point control. The whole problem results from  
poor quality updates or none at all.

In examining this problem with MIT, it was determined that approximately  
eight words of the program would have to be changed to eliminate it. Of  
these, six words are three double precision constants and two are program  
steps of some type, I think. They are all located in a single rope module  
and since they are so completely isolated, a minimum re-verification effort  
is required to certify the changes for flight.

Ropes for the AS-501 program are currently being manufactured by Raytheon.  
It would be unwise both in terms of schedule and cost to interfere with  
their completion. The rope modules which they are now producing will be  
perfectly adequate for verification tests and could even be used in  
flight if we are willing to accept the danger of an erroneous state vector  
update or the failure of it to be received. On the other hand, it is  
currently our consensus that we would be wise to manufacture a single new  
module to be substituted in the spacecraft when it's available. It will  
cost about $15,000 and will take about 30 days to make starting after  
delivery of those now in process. The cost in effort and treasure is  
justifiably small to procure the insurance the new rope would provide  
for possible update problems, particularly ocnsidering the current  
level of confidence we have in that business. It is our intention to  
proceed unless directed otherwise.

Incidentally, it is my understanding that one of the maneuvers on the  
AS-502 mission is carried out at an altitude in excess of 3,000 n.mi.  
and thus we will have no choice but to make this correction for that flight.
