Jerry, I've done a lot of joking about the spacecraft hitting the
aircraft carrier, but the more I think about it the less I feel it
is a joke. There are reports that the C Prime command module came
down right over the aircraft carrier and drifted on the chute to
land 5,000 yards away. This really strikes me as being too close.
In other words, I realize the probability of the spacecraft hitting
the aircraft carrier is very low but there is absolutely no [unintelligible]
in having the ship within five or ten miles of the aim point - with
the possible exception of the PAO [unintelligible] for good commercial
TV. It certainly does not improve the recovery operation at all.
And, the consequence of the spacecraft hitting the carrier is truly catastrophic.

In summary, I seriously recommend relocating the recovery force at
least five or ten miles from the target point.
