subject: Ground rules for MIT man loading for AGC programming

This is really for my own records, but in case you are interested, we  
presented the following ground rules to MIT with Bill Kelly's (ASPO's  
MIT Contractual Officer) concurrence. These ground rules were to cover  
the work they are doing in revising their man loading estimates for  
contract negotiations which are coming up in the next couple of months  
covering their work for calender year 1967.

1) Unique programs, both hardwire and erasable, are required  
only for:
a) AS-204, AS-206, AS-207, AS-208, AS-208B LM
b) AS-501, AS-503 CM, AS-504 LM, AS-504 CSM
  
2) Aside from AS-208B (i.e., AS-278B), no special programs are  
currently planned for any backup or contingency missions.

3) Although follow-on flights are scheduled, no unique hardwire  
programs are to be developed in their support.

4) However, for scheduled missions not listed above, it is recognized  
that work is required of MIT which must be man loaded, such as:
a) Generation and verification of erasable memory.
b) Update of documentation.
c) Additional verification and perhaps error analyses associated  
with differences in the mission plan from that for which the  
program was originally developed.
d) Etc.

5) MDRB action is certain. MIT shall man load to support this  
activity, defining the extent to which they plan to be able to respond;  
i.e., number and complexit of MDRB's anticipated per mission.

6) No AAP or EXPO (e.g., AS-504C) missions are to included in the  
man loading.

7) It is recognized that a number of missions will be transferred  
from the main line Apollo to AAP or EXPO which will require programming  
support from MIT. This work will be covered by contract changes based  
on negotiations with MIT at a later date.

Incidentally, Larry Fry and I made a rough estimate of the probable decrease  
of the MIT proposal as a result of deleting AAP effort from the the  
original proposal. It came out to be in the order of $500,000. We are  
also doing a certain amount of trimming in other area which may yield  
up to another $500,000 or so, but I expect that will be about the limit.
