Ken, this is to remind you that you are carrying the ball for getting 
high rate CDU data on the downlink during DPS burns if you feel it is 
necessary for postflight analysis of the Digital Auto Pilot. MIT 
people, particularly George Cherry, are emphatic in stating this data 
is mandatory for DAP development and they claim you are in complete 
accord on this. I imagine it will be a tough battle for you, so I 
suggest you get it going as soon as possible. Our guys in Flight 
Software Branch will assist you in any way you request, I'm sure.
