We had another long AS-206 program development discussion at MIT on 
January 26th, and some things came up your might find interesting. 

First of all, there is only one mission phase that has not been successfully 
run at this time - namely, the second APS maneuver. There 
is some feeling that this may be due to improper targeting as opposed 
to problems in the actual program. Completion of a satisfactory test 
of this mission phase will signal configuration control of the assembly 
to be maintained until the final release of the program. It is 
planned that verification testing to assure flight readiness will be 
complete on February 15th, and we've set February 17th as the date for 
the formal MSC review of the AS-206 program verification results. Final 
acceptance of the program, prior to rope manufacture, is based on this 
MIT presentation which will be here in Houston.

Although MIT insists that the Digital Auto Pilots are adequate for the 
mission, there are several program modifications under consideration 
in this area. In fact, MDRB's have been requested from mIT which must 
be acted upon very promptly if they are to be included. Briefly, they 
are the following:

  a) As I understand it, an instability, due to fuel slosh, has 
  been discovered making it desirable to modify the Kalman filter gains 
  in the DPS DAP. As presently designed, when the RCS tanks get fairly 
  empty, fuel slosh causes control to oscillate back and forth between the 
  DPS and RCS Digital Auto Pilots. This results in inefficient use of RCS 
  fuel, although it does provide adequate control of the vehicle. Since 
  AS-206 does not have an RCS propellant shortage, it is not mandatory to 
  make the change until a later mission. The primary advantage of doing 
  it now is to get a test of the "ultimate" system.
  
  b) At some time during the DPS maneuver, it was intended to freeze 
  the DPS engine position, i.e., no further steering commands would be 
  given to the DPS and all control would be carried out with the RCS. This 
  had been proposed as an interim fix of the instability problem noted in 
  (a), but subsequent testing at Grumman of the DAP on their digital simulation 
  has shown that misalignment of the thrust vector from the spacecraft 
  cg actually results in a greater use of RCS fuel than is spent in 
  controlling the fuel slosh induced instability. We have requested an 
  MDRB to fix the program so that it does not freeze the engine position. 
  (Incidentally, there is concern that engine bell ablation or erosion 
  may cause large thrust vector misalignment, and freezing the engine 
  deflection during the maneuver could present a significant problem in 
  that event).
  
  c) MIT is very much concerned that insufficient data will be 
  collected during the AS-206 flight for adequate analysis of the Digital 
  Auto Pilots. It has been found that the PCM data will be saturated due 
  to the unusual platform alignment which is required on this mission.
  Therefore, they are anxious to obtain another source of this data which 
  they have identified as essential from the very beginning. One of their 
  proposals is that the downlink be interrupted for four or five seconds 
  during the DPS maneuver, substituting in it's place CDU data sampled 
  every twenty milliseconds. Further, they fell it would be highly desirable 
  to suppress the DAP during this period in order that the data be 
  independent of control activity. Almost surely this type of program 
  modification will cost a lot of time even if agreement could be reached 
  by all parties that is was an acceptable change technically.
  
I predict we will not make change (a) but will make change (b) since 
it's so simple. I really am concerned about not getting the DAP data 
for postflight analysis since that is one of the primary reaons for 
flying the mission in the first place. Resolution of whether or not to 
make change (c) will probably bounce all of the way up to the Spacecraft 
Program Manager.

MIT reported that it looks like nothing can be done in either the hardware 
or software to fix the AS-206 downrupt problem. This, you recall, 
is the problem resulting from higher priority computer tasks preventing 
the computer from servicing the downlink needs ever so often during 
maneuvers. This causes that data frame to be garbled on the ground. As 
I understand it, it is possible to unscramble this data postflight, thus 
it is only a real time flight control problem which we have recognized 
and agreed to live with on this mission.

I hear that Grumman has not yet been able to use the tapes delivered to 
them due to problems with their own facility. I get the distinct impression 
that we have been "bad" on this. Apparently Grumman knew their 
facility would not be ready on schedule, and in order to salvage their 
inventive points, got us (MSC) to give them a waiver based on our confession 
that the GFE computer program would not be available as promised. 
I guess we Texans are no match for these slick New York yankees. 

That's about it. Obviously our toughest job is going to be wrenching 
this program out of MIT's grasp, since to them quality still comes before 
schedule. But that's just a little game we are playing, and I don't 
consider it unhappily. I'm really not near as worried about the quality 
of the AS-206 program as they are, but I am very anxious to get this 
bunch of experienced AS-206 guys off onto the AS-278 programs as soon as 
possible.
