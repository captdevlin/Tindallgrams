I guess I ought to record the saga of the MIT 360 computer, if only so  
that it may take it's proper place in history. It is a little adventure  
which has been going on in the shadow of the more dramatic crises at MIT  
and is now rising to the surface in it's own right. Although it looked  
as though there was not much we could do about it except watch in fascinated  
horror, we have taken some steps which I hope will be effective  
and which might interest you.

As far as I can tell, somewhat less than a year ago MIT foresaw tha the  
two Minneapolis Honeywell 1800 digital computers they are using for spacecraft  
computer program development would be inadequate at some time in the   
future. In the absence of good programming plans, it's hard to know how  
they either predicted this would be the case or were able to convince anyone  
of it. In fact, I guess they did have a bit of trouble since it wasn't  
until June that they were finally given the go-ahead to procure an IBM 360  
by MSC. Installation of this computer has proceeded, along with training  
of MIT personnel to use it. IBM contracted to supply some important special  
programs, which they have apparently delivered on schedule, and MIT  
has prepared some others to permit use of this facility. But the one  
which now appears to be the most critical of all is the MAC compiler - a  
complicated service program which translate symbolic programs into computer  
language. MAC is the MIT equivalent of IBM's Fortran, except that it is  
said to be superior. The development of this program was contracted to  
Hankins - a Boston outfit employing between 40 and 80 people, depending on  
who tells you. The compiler was to cost about $170,000 and was to be  
delivered January 15th with a $200 a day penalty clause in the contract  
for late delivery; Hankins refused and incentive reward for earlier delivery.  
I have no idea how the January 15 date was selected. But I am certain of  
one thing - it is about two months too late. The fact is the AS-206 program  
development by itself has now saturated the two 1800 digital computers  
and it's evident the situation is going to become much worse before the  
IBM 360 becomes operational. Debugging and integration of the AS-207 and  
AS-208 programs has just begun, and this activity will impose a very heavy  
load on the digital computer facilities very soon.

Hankins is not going to deliver on schedule. They estimate a slip of about  
approximately 6 weeks. Of course, delivery of the MAC compiler around the  
1st of March does not by any means guarantee operational capability at  
that time - it will probably take at least another month to get the  
system working. Unquestionably the lack of adequate digital computer  
facilities at MIT during the first months of next year is going to impact  
delivery of the AS-207/208 programs badly, which is going to be extremely  
painful to bear.
