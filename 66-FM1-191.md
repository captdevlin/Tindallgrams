I guess I ought to record the saga of the MIT 360 computer, if only so  
that it may take it's proper place in history. It is a little adventure  
which has been going on in the shadow of the more dramatic crises at MIT  
and is now rising to the surface in it's own right. Although it looked  
as though there was not much we could do about it except watch in fascinated  
horror, we have taken some steps which I hope will be effective  
and which might interest you.

As far as I can tell, somewhat less than a year ago MIT foresaw tha the  
two Minneapolis Honeywell 1800 digital computers they are using for spacecraft  
computer program development would be inadequate at some time in the   
future. In the absence of good programming plans, it's hard to know how  
they either predicted this would be the case or were able to convince anyone  
of it. In fact, I guess they did have a bit of trouble since it wasn't  
until June that they were finally given the go-ahead to procure an IBM 360  
by MSC. Installation of this computer has proceeded, along with training  
of MIT personnel to use it. IBM contracted to supply some important special  
programs, which they have apparently delivered on schedule, and MIT  
has prepared some others to permit use of this facility. But the one  
which now appears to be the most critical of all is the MAC compiler - a  
complicated service program which translate symbolic programs into computer  
language. MAC is the MIT equivalent of IBM's Fortran, except that it is  
said to be superior. The development of this program was contracted to  
Hankins - a Boston outfit employing between 40 and 80 people, depending on  
who tells you. The compiler was to cost about $170,000 and was to be  
delivered January 15th with a $200 a day penalty clause in the contract  
for late delivery; Hankins refused and incentive reward for earlier delivery.  
I have no idea how the January 15 date was selected. But I am certain of  
one thing - it is about two months too late. The fact is the AS-206 program  
development by itself has now saturated the two 1800 digital computers  
and it's evident the situation is going to become much worse before the  
IBM 360 becomes operational. Debugging and integration of the AS-207 and  
AS-208 programs has just begun, and this activity will impose a very heavy  
load on the digital computer facilities very soon.

Hankins is not going to deliver on schedule. They estimate a slip of about  
approximately 6 weeks. Of course, delivery of the MAC compiler around the  
1st of March does not by any means guarantee operational capability at  
that time - it will probably take at least another month to get the  
system working. Unquestionably the lack of adequate digital computer  
facilities at MIT during the first months of next year is going to impact  
delivery of the AS-207/208 programs badly, which is going to be extremely  
painful to bear.

What can be done about this? Well, MIT ha sobtained as much programming  
assistance for Hankins as is worthwhile in an attempt to prevent his  
delivery schedule from slipping even further, although I sure wouldn't  
count on it. We are attempting to identify all tasks that could be  
transferred from MIT to our CDC 3600 simulation facility at MSC. We have  
also offered to supply our 3600 software packages to MIT when completed  
about the first of the year for their use on whatever 3600 systems are  
available to them in the Boston area. These steps may help some, but do not  
really solve the basic problem - namely what has happened at Hankins. In  
spite of recent discussions with them emphasizing the importance of this  
pacing item, it becomes apparent that management of that organization is  
immature and unstable - completely unreliable. MIT and MSC have agreed  
that to maintain an approach depending solely upon Hankins is unacceptable.  
In our joint search for some way to work around this problem, it has been  
concluded that the best "backup" course of action is to replace the MIT  
developed MAC programming system with the IBM Fortran which, of course,  
exists right now and is said to be working well on the 360. This makes it  
necessary to complete recode the simulation programs, those defining the  
environment, spacecraft systems, world earth models, etc., into Fortran.  
However, since these two compiling systems are so similar, this conversion  
is not expected to be a very difficult or complex task although it will be  
time consuming. These programs are very large. Since the CDC 3600  
facility here at MSC will also use these MIT simulation programs, we have  
been routinely obtaining and documenting them, It's our intention to supply  
this material to MIT for the use of their subcontrasctor, probably IBM, who  
will be given the task of this conversion. It is anticipated that parts of  
this simulation will be available for use during the latter part of January  
and the complete package should be finished in less than two months. Thus  
it is evident that this is a quicker approach for getting the IBM 360 online  
even if you believe thje new Hankins delivery schedule. But I must say  
I have no faith whatsoever in that roganization in spite of MIT's valiant  
efforts to support them.

I am very pleased to report that key personnel at MIT have given enthusiastic  
and wholehearted support to this plan. They have worked very hard  
to solve the problems and to get IBM on-board and working promptly and  
efficiently. I understand that if the Fortran approach succeeds as we  
anticipate it will, MIT will probably not maintain the simulation programs  
in MAC language for the 360 but will convert over completely to Fortran.  
Of course, they will hav eot carry along the MAC simulation system for the  
1800 computers as long as we continue to use them at MIT. My personal  
opinion is that we will still be using them at the end of next year.

Aside from cutting back on the programs and thus reducing the work required,  
relieving the overloaded digital computer facilities at MIT  
seems to me to be the only course of action available to improve the  
delivery schedule for the AS-205 and AS-208 programs. Although it has  
taken some tiem to arrive at this solution, I believe it to be the best  
we can do unless you weant to pray that the flight schedule will slip.
