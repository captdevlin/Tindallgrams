Ken Cox, Rick Nobles, Charley Parker and I got together to see what could  
be done about reducing the number of crew displays and inputs associated  
with the digital auto pilot (DAP). As you recall, the Dap's require initialization  
by the crew who specify the spacecraft configuration, choice  
of RCS quads to be used, dead-band, RCS jet failures, etc. These quantities  
are displayed to the crew prior to each maneuver and must be overridden  
if unsatisfactory. We see no way around those displays and inputs.

It was our desire to attempt to reduce or eliminate the requirement for  
input of additional quantities such as spacecraft weight, moments of inertia,  
initial engine gimbal angle settings, etc., prior to the intiation  
of main engine maneuvers. It has been noted on numerous occasions that all  
of these parameters could be determined by the computer itself to well  
within the degree of accuracy required. For example, it should be sufficient  
that the final engine trim angles experienced during the previous  
maneuver be used at the start of the next; the weight and moments of inertia  
are more-or-less dependent upon the amount of main engine propellant  
which has been expended. A running account of the propellant expended  
could be continuously carried in the computer probably based on dVm, which  
is computed during each maneuver. Ken Cox has prepared curves of each of  
these quantities as functions of weight which can be used to prepare linear  
approximations as functions of the summation of dVm to be supplied to MIT.

It is to be emphasized that the only reason these parameters need be computed  
on board is to provide a backp for communication failure or lack of  
a ground station at the time it is needed since it is the intetion of the  
Flight Contrl Division to update these parameters from the ground routinely.  
Therefore, it is our desire that these quantities be computed and  
stored away in the computer at the conclusion of each main engine maneuver  
rather than just before the next so that the groun dsupplied data is not  
wiped out by the less accurate values computed onboard.

It is our intention to tell MIT that there is no requirement to display  
these quantities to the crew, and the program will be designed that way  
unless we are informed that this is unacceptable by representatives of the  
flight crew. If they feel it's necessary to see these displays, then it  
must be with the understanding that there will be no special automatic  
updating of these quanitites. Rick Nobles is going to check this out.

MIT was requested to prepare an MDRB based on a description of the requirements  
noted above given to them over the phone on December 19. We'll  
attempt to get it in AS-258 but if the schedule impact is too great (as it  
probably will be) we'll get it in AS-504.
