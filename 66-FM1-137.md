Just got back from the northlands and couldn't resist sending out another  
note, although I really don't have much to report. The program development  
planning at MIT seems to be progressing nicely. We did pick up a  
couple of items that require attention; e.g.,

a) It is necessary that NASA provide specifications on the characteristics  
of the command signals from the AGC to the SIVB for the translunar  
injection simulation maneuver in the AS-278/503 computer program.  
Rick Nobles (FSB) has the action on this.

It was re-emphasized by MIT that they are not developing the capability  
of confirming stability of the over-all system. Their model of the SIVB  
is strictly rigid body and is not adequate for that purpose. It is my  
understanding that MSFC will perform whatever studies are necessary to  
confirm adequate stability for this maneuver mode. This will be discussed  
at the MSC/MSFC Flight Mechanics Panel meeting this week.

b) Studies continue at MIT on the formulation of the offset targeting  
to support the stable orbit rendezvous technique. This simulation work is  
required to prepare the framework of an MDRB [program change request].
This work should be completed within about two weeks, at which time they  
will prepare the MDRB. MIT is proceeding on the assumption that this capability  
shall be provided on both the LM and command module with an option  
available for each to compute the maneuvers necessary if the other vehicle  
is active.

c) An investigation is currently underway at MSC to determine the  
advisability of starting the LM descent propulsion system at 10% thrust  
rather than 30% thrust. It will simplify the LGC program, but since the  
formulation and coding must be completed very soon, we will derive very  
little benefit from this change if a decision is not made very soon. In  
fact, there will come a time where the change will make out job more  
difficult.

d) Since so much concern has been expressed, both at MSC and MIT,  
with regard to the need for star/landmark and/or star/horizon navigation  
on the AS-503 mission, I have requested MIT to prepare and MDRB for including  
that capability in the AS-278/503 program. Sicne the formulation  
of these programs has been prett well completed, I expect the major impact  
will be in having to finish all the coding in time for initiation of program  
systems integration which is scheduled to begin early in December.

MIT reported that their work on the action items assigned them at the  
AS-204 CAR are essentially complete.

a) Procedures for manual computer re-start will be availabe  
October 14th. [Incidentally, MIT feels this action should never be  
carried out and certainly don't guarantee it; however, in accordance  
with our request they have laid out the best procedures they could for  
manually forcing the computer to re-start from a known location].

b) On October 14th they will provide a list of parameter which  
must be input into the erasable memory if a complete loss of erasable  
memory occurs. Procedures for carrying out this process will be  
ready by October 21st.

c) A complete description of the Flag Word will be available  
October 14th.

d) A description of how to correct the PIPA bias, etc., will be  
available on October 14th. Documentation of detailed crew procedures will be completed by October 21st.
