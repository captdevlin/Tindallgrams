On Octber 6th at MIT, we held a review of the AS-206 computer program 
which they have romantically christened "Sunburst".  Our primary objectives 
were twofold; first, to make certain that the formulation of 
the program was consistent with the way we intend to fly the mission, 
and second, to determine the current status of the program development. 
Generally speaking, I would say we are in good shape on the AS-206. We 
appear to be on schedule with some tolerance for problems of a nature 
you ordinarily expect to encounter in this type of work, and with a few 
exceptions, the program as currently defined should be entirely adequate 
to support the mission.

It is still planned to release this program for rope manufacture on December 
26th. This date has held firm for a number of months now; and 
Jim Miller, who has taken over direction of this program at MIT in the 
absence of hospitalized George Cherry, presented fairly detailed program 
development plans upon which he based his confidence of staying on 
that schedule.  He identified as the two most critical items: 

a) The descent guidance for Mission Phase 2 (i.e., the second DPS 
maneuver), and

b) The digital auto pilot which is also the major processor 
remaining to be completed. Jim pointed out that a number of processors 
have been coded and unit tested which are now awaiting the availability 
of the DAP for integrated systems tests.

Jim Miller has beefed up the manpower in both of these areas recently.

5here was one item requiring immediate attention if anything is to be 
done about it. This involves the manner in which the LGC is set into 
action at Saturn launch. Apparently, the program is started by the 
receipt of a guidance reference release (GRR) signal sent some 3 minutes 
and 10 seconds prior to liftoff by the Houston MCC command system. 
There are two things that sound kind of lousy to me; one is the desirability 
of having to send a command from a remote site to start the system 
working, and the second is the fact that it is currently planned to 
send this signal so long prior to liftoff.  Obviously, the problem here 
is that if a hold in the countdown is encountered after it is sent, it 
is necessary to recycle the launch countdown back as much as 2 or 3 
hours which sounds completely unacceptable.  I wouldn't be surprised if
I have this all confused. If you are concerned with this type of thing, 
I suggest you get ahold of someone who knows what they are talking about 
for a precise description of the situation.  Incidentally, if program 
changes are required associated with this GRR problem, there is a possibility 
of schedule implications.

Another item on which we spent a considerable amount of time had to do 
with the implementation of two jet ullage, which is desired on AS-206 in 
order to make the DAP for that mission consistent with the DAP for 
AS-208.  A question arose as to whether there should be some sort of 
interlock to inhibit the main engine start signal based on onboard sensing 
of ullage, or rather lack of it. It was finally decided that we 
should leave the program essentially as it is with a fixed duration of 
ullage and an engine start signal issued by the LGC at a particular time 
in the sequence.  This was primarily to insure that the tests performed 
on AS-206 are applicable to AS-208.  MIT did request that we direct
Grumman to provide RCS jet fail indications to the LGC for use in their 
automatic jet select logic in a somewhat different way than is currently 
planned.

Other matters receiving consideration at this meeting were:

a) The possibility of utilizing the LGC to keep track of RCS fuel 
used and remaining -- a job which apparently can not be done accurately 
in any other manner. MIT expressed reservations that the LGC would be 
able to do this accurately either.  In addition, there may be computer 
cycle time problems since this processor would have to operate simultaneously 
with the DAP which is already heavily loading the computer.

b) The matter of increasing the size of the downlink lists from 
100 to 200 words on the AS-206 program since FCD expects that this will 
be necessary for the later LM's.

MIT indicated that they intend to issue a new, complete GSOP around the 
end of November.  The last one, R-527, was dated June 1966.  MIT intends
to release certain parts of this earlier since it is badly needed by 
some parties right now.
