Following our AS-206 spacecraft computer program status review at MIT on
October 6th, we launched into a discussion of the AS-278B mission and 
its demands on the guidance system. This alternate mission, you recall,
is one in which the LM and command module are launched separately 
followed by a CSM active rendezvous. The LM would then be manned and a 
number of spacecraft systems tests would be carried out, perhaps including 
a LM active station keeping exercise and docking. This would be 
followed by an unmanned sequence of LM maneuvers basically the same as 
currently planned for the primary AS-206 mission.

After considerable discussion to establish what seemed to us to be 
reasonable mission constraints, we arrived at the following list of 
programs needed to augment the AS-206 program for use on the AS-278B 
mission. You will note that all of the changes are associated solely 
with the function of determining the orientation of the platform or 
aligning it prior to the AS-206 maneuver sequence.

1. Platform orientation determination is required and maybe a 
platform alignment program is also required, although we don't think so.

2. Star catalogue and associated data handling routines must be added.

3. Modifications to the routine providing pilot interface with 
the computer, i.e., input and displays will probably be required.

4. Preparation of an addendum to the GSOP would be needed and it 
is to be emphasized that this work would be applicable to the AS-278B 
mission only.

The following routines were also considered but are apparently not needed 
for the reasons listed.

1. G&N power-on and power-off progams. These programs, which are 
routinely provided on manned spacecraft to assist the pilot in turning 
on and off this equipment, are probably not needed since it is thought 
this process can be carried out manually, and it is strictly a one-time 
affair; i.e., as far as we could tell it is only necessary to turn on 
the equipment one time and never to turn it off.

2. Some thought was given to adding special digital auto pilot 
modes for RCS translation and rotation using the hand controller. Here 
again it is MIT's impression that processors are available in the current 
AS-206 program which can be utilized in the station keeping and 
docking exercise.

3. LGC initialization primarily associated with state vector and 
clock alignment updating. Apparently is is already possible in the 
AS-206 program to input these quantities both via uplink and DSKY.

4. Special programs to initialize and start the AS-206 maneuver 
sequence. Apparently the present AS-206 program already has these capabilities 
by means of uplink and DSKY inputs. 

As you can see, the list of programs required has really been reduced to 
a minimum. In addition, these programs are probably required in very 
nearly the same form for the later missions, which means work on them 
is not entirely wasted. The list was kept this small by assuming that 
certain constraints on the mission were acceptable. In large part: this 
was done by carrying out a number of functions, manually by the crew, 
which are ordinarily under computer control. This will be apparent by 
glancing through the following list of constraints which I certainly 
don't claim to be complete, and in fact, some of the items listed may 
not even need to be there.

1. No provision is made for re-rendezvous in the LGC. In this 
category, note there is no processing of the LM rendezvous radar by the 
LGC nor is there attitude control in the LM program for aligning its 
rendezvous lights toward the CSM.

2. It is assumed that no change will be required to the AS-206 
maneuver sequence program. I would like to point out, however, that 
considerable flexibility exists in the targeting and timing of the 
maneuver as the program is presently formulated.

3. Platform alignment to within about 5Â° of the preferred orientation 
about all 3 axes is acceptable for the AS-206 maneuver sequence. 
The intent here is to provide a coarse alignment of the platform while 
docked through use of the command module G&N. Of course, it would then 
be necessary to determine precisely the resulting orientation of the 
LM platform.

4. There will be no provision in the LC to assist the astronaut 
in locating stars in the AOT. This must be done manually with whatever 
assistance is possible from the CSM.

5. It is probable the crew must check contents of the erasable 
memory word by word via the DSKY to insure that all critical parameters 
are stored properly after the LGC is turned on the first time.  I am 
referring here to quantities such as accelerometer bias: scaling factor, 
etc., equivalent to those quantities loaded by the K-start tape prior to
launch. This is probably not unique to AS-278B.

6. The only DSKY display programs to be implemented will be associated
with the platform orientation determination program and those 
required for the crew to check out the contents of the erasable memory.

7. The G&N power-on and power-off sequence will be carried out 
manually by the crew.

8. An LMP will be available and in operation.

9. The RCS will be manually purged and pressurized.

10. The S&C band will be turned on manually.

11. The ECS primary water coolant valve will be manually activated.

12. No C or S band antenna steering will be provided.

13. No LGC AGS initialization will be provided.

14. If LM cold soak is required in the docked configuration, the 
CSM shall do it.

15. The LM shall always be extracted from the SIVB by the CSM even 
if LM  1 spaceraft changes are required [I am not certain this is a 
constraint imposed by the computer program].

16. The LM will be powered down during launch and until manned [here 
again I am not certain this is a program constraint].  This implies 
  
    a) There will be no launch T-M 
  
    b) There will be no launch abort or contingency orbit insertion
    capability.

[If it is determined that the LM can be launched powered-up, I should 
point out that the AS-206 program does provide these capabilities.]

Of course, the status of the AS-278B alternate mission is still quite
confused.  As I have indicated previously, it is our intention to do 
nothing now at MIT in support of this mission except to make sure the 
programs identified above, currently being prepared for the AS-278 
program, are given enough priority to assure their readiness when the 
decision must be made around the end of November as to what we are going 
to do.  In addition, we will attempt to determine what, if any, impact 
this activity would have on the AS-278/503 and the AS-504 spacecraft
computer program development schedule. I would be very interested to
hear from those of you concerned with this matter if you feel that either 
the list of programs or constraints given above are not accurate or adequate 
in some way.
