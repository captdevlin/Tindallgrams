This is a note primarily to myself to remind me of impressions obtained
during the MCC-H Ascent Monitoring meeting of January 24, 1969. Although
it appeared that the prime program for processing MSFN data was to be the
"Lear," I feel quite strongly that the old, directly doppler-measurement
technique should be retained for in-plane monitoring. The only situation
_it_ cannot support is ascent from the central landing site with a bad z-axis
accelerometer. It seems to me, at least for now, that the Lear-Processor
should only be used prime for out-of-plane - the situation the old technique
can do nothing for. According to _Steve Bales_, their planes for RTCC program
and MCC-H display implementation are in complete accord with this idea. It
is only necessary to make the decision to do it this way on the G mission.

Another thing I am particularly concerned about is an apparent willingness
to allow the trajectory to become badly dispersed before switchover from
a failing PGNCS and thus to accept what could be a very poor rendezvous
situation compounded by a failed PGNCS to do the rendezvous. In order to
avoid this, two things must be done.

a. First, we must determine how serious it is to switchover to the
AGS _as soon as it is recognized that the PGNCS is not working as well
as the AGS_. This you see is not a question of pre-flight expected performance
of the two systems but rather actual, observed performance in
real time. The only reservation against switchover, it seems to me, is
the hazard incurred by the actual operation of switchover itself.

b. Secondly, there appears to be a need to establish display section
lines or techniques involving displays other than the predicted insertion
display. This is necessary since the predicted perigee vs. wedge angle
display do not reveal a problem until long after it occurs. It seems to
me it should be possible to establish some technique which would result in
taking action much sooner. One consideration which must be analyzed before
adopting this technique, however, is to determine the effect of delaying
the switchover action since, if the AGS is capable of returning the spacecraft
to a near nominal trajectory at little Î”V cost, there is no point
in taking the action early.
