We spent a lot of time at MIT last week wrestling with the AS-206 problem.  
Although in a previous note I expressed some optimisim regarding  
possibility of recovering some of the one month slip MIT draped on us,  
they have convinced me now that there is really not much chance. As a  
result we pretty well convinced ourselves that it will be necessary to  
release a tape on December 27th, our old flight program release date,  
for manufacturing ropes to be used for spacecraft systems tests at the  
Cape. At least this "B-release" will be needed unless the Aurora 88  
programs can satisfy that requirement. MIT points out that if it is  
necessary for them to test the B-release assembly and determine it's  
deficiencies, that effort will result in a further delay in rleease of  
the flight program. We are looking into the possibility of doing that  
sort of program checkout on the Bit-by-Bit simulator here at MSC if it  
can be made ready in time. It appears to me we can't do much more to  
improve the situation.

MIT has brought in superstars Alex Kosmala and George Cherry on a parttime  
basis even at the detriment of program development for the AS-278  
mission; we have reduced the program requirements to the limit even to  
the extent of deleting thorough restart protection - a subject which I   
shall discuss in a little more depth later. We are retracing the AS-204  
footsteps almost exactly and as we did that time will attempt to derive  
maximum benefit from whatever flight schedule slips are experienced,  
although right now we certainly can't count on anything like that.

Regarding the elimination of restart protection, I would like to point  
out that this isn't a closed issue since G&C have expressed much concern  
over this. Apparently in the design of the Block II computer, decisions  
were made based on the assumption that restart protection would be provided  
in the software. They feel the probability of encountering restart  
situations on Block II flights is relatively high and could result in  
disaster if not handled properly. Ed Copps made a guess that to provide  
complete restart protection would cost another couple of weeks for program  
delivery, but it must be emphasized that that is just a guess. I  
gather that it really is a rather complex process to go through the program  
and make it completely insensitive to interruptions which can occur  
at any time. Our, current direction to MIT is to provide restart protection  
for those periods during which the probability of occurence is very  
high, such as staging from the descent to ascent power. At other times,  
in the event of an interruption, the computer will send the engine-off  
signal and will release the digital auto pilot. Protection of the state  
vector and current time is also provided and mission phase registers are  
cleared such that no further activity will be called for by the computer.  
What this amounts to is that things are put into a more or less dormant  
state which will be known to the ground pre-mission such that it should  
be possible to issue new commands in an intelligent manner to get things  
going again. It probably will be a major undertaking in the MCC and may  
have implications on the RTCC program. Obviously it's not a good substitute  
for restar protection. Therefore, we have requested MIT to examine  
this subject in more depth, ifrst of all identifying to us procedures to  
be carrired out if we stick with the program as described above, and second  
to let us know with somewhat more precision the schedule impact associated  
with more complete restart protection.

Part of our meeting at MIT included participation by Grumman, which  
result in a couple of things. First of all, in response to our strong  
recommendation, they have finally agreed to send one of their men to MIT  
on an almost full time basis for the next month or so in order to provide  
themselves with a first-hand knowledge of the program status as it devlops.  
MIT is completely in accord with this. Another matter discussed  
concerned Grumman's recommendation that a third APS maneuver be carried  
out. An on-the-spot assessment of this indicated that it should be  
possible to initiate such a maneuver from the ground using the APS-2  
mission phase processors and that no program additions would be required  
if Grumman were successful in talking the ASPO office into doing it.

And that's about it -
