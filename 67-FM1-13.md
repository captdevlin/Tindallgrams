The current status of Abort Guidance System (AGS) software documentation 
is given here in reply to the referenced memorandum concerning 
the same subject.

The LM AGS Software Development and Verification Plan, dated May 25, 
1966, is currently being revised. Among other things, the content 
of the Operating Procedures Document contained in Design Report #3 
for each mission will be redefined and the procedure by which MSC 
reviews and officially approves LM AGS Design Reports will be changed.

The Operating Procedures Document was not originally intended to be 
an all-inclusive document to be used by the flight crew for operational 
planning. However, since it could be used for that purpose if written 
with that objective in mind, we will take steps to incorporate your 
recommendations.

The Operating Procedures Document and Design Report #3 for the AS-258 
mission will be released in a few days. This document will not contain 
the changes discussed by Cmdr. Mitchell with MPAD and THW personnel on 
January 19, 1967. However, these changes and those listed in the referenced 
memorandum will be incorporated into the AS-503 Operating Procedures 
Document. Preliminary copies of this document will be available 
for your review by February 15, 1967. The final AS-503 document will 
be available by March 1. It is expected that the AS-258 and 
AS-503 AGS program and procedures will not be different. Therefore, 
the final AS-503 documents may be used in your work in preparation for 
both the AS-258 and AS-503 flights. If this is not the case, differences 
will be clearly pointed out in the AS-503 documentation.
