This note is to back up our telephone conversation (1/5/67) in which I  
requested you to prepare our recommendation as to how the AGC should be  
used during the simulated translunar injection maneuver on AS-503. It's  
certain the crew will want to monitor the progress of this large SIVB  
maneuver, even though it's controlled by the Saturn guidance system.  
You were to find out what capabilities exist in the AS-205/503 program  
for use during this mission phase. For example, one possible solution  
is for the crew to observe a display of velocity, altitude and altitude  
rate if this launch phase processor is functional at that time.
