The fact that the 206 LM is the only LM to be powered up when launched  
presents a requirement for some unique manner for the G&N to detect or  
at least be informed that liftoff has occurred. In the absence of a  
hardwire liftoff signal, it had been intedned to transmit a guidance  
reference release (GRR) discrete by means of an RF link to the guidance  
system at a pre-determined time prior to liftoff. Most recently this  
value was at T-30 seconds in the countdown. One this signal was sent  
there was no way to stop the platform from being released and the computer  
transmitting commands on its preset sequence. This has caused a great  
deal of concern everywhere, - at MIT, at the Cape, and here at MSC since  
Saturn countdown history includes some rather weird holds. Our problem  
was that any interuption in the countdown occurring after GRR was transmitted  
would force a recycle of about 2 hours to get the G&N squared away  
again and could very likely result in scrubbing that launch attempt. MIT  
has proposed a fix for this by a change in the spacecraft computer program  
which we have decided to implement. It is the purpose of this memorandum  
to inform you of this rather significant programming chance.

In place of a hardwire or RF signal of liftoff, we intend to detect the  
change in acceleration that occurs at liftoff by the guidance system  
itself. Since the platform is activated long before this time, it is  
merely necessary to provide a small, relatively simple program for monitoring  
the dV which, when a pre-established threshold has been exceeded,  
could provide a discrete to be treated precisely as the GRR signal.  Obviously  
this is not any gigantic breakthrough except in the sense we have  
decided to do it. Although the oncept seems well founded, I'm sure there  
will be some continuing discussions as to the threshold to be selected.  
MIT is currently proposing...

of the flight will insist that the G&N dV monitor be prime and the GRR  
discrete via RF would be sent only as a backup in the event some G&N failure  
has been detected immediately after liftoff.

It is probably worth pointing out that MIT is anxious to make this change  
and are confident that it is something they can really do without running  
into trouble. They feel the impact on program delivery is negligible and  
in fact point out that their effort required for this programming change  
and its verification will probably be less than that required for the development  
of workaround procedures involved in the recycle countdown. If  
we run into some sort of insurmountable problem not unforseen at this time,  
it should be a relatively simple matter to retreat to the system we had  
before this change, at least insofar as the spacecraft computer prograsm is  
concerned. The basic porgramming to handle the GRR signal is not being  
changed. Accordingly, if we revert to the procedure of sending GRR at  
T-30 seconds it will only be necessary to change the value of this time in  
the erasable load.

Well, that's about it. I hope everyone will be happy about this. I know  
I am, if it only cuts down on the number of telephone calls on this horrible  
subject.
