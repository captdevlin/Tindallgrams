subject: "D" Rendezvous Mission Techniques meeting of July 22

1. We cleaned up a lot of stuff at the subject meeting. Attached 
are updated "Ground Rules, Working Agreements, and other things," 
and another list of open items to be discussed at our next meeting 
currently scheduled for September 6, 1968, or whenever the crew is 
available after that.

2. One facet of this business that has become extremely critical 
involves how to do rendezvous navigation! The tracking schedule 
overwhelms and influences everything else the crew is doing. It 
is essential that it be established immediately along with W-Matrix 
initialization procedures - whatever that is - taking into account 
the rendezvous radar thermal control required, etc. If all this 
changes much from that which has been assumed to be proper, crew 
training - among other things - will be severely impacted. Accordingly, 
a Rendezvous Navigation Mission Techniques Panel is being 
established to concentrate on this and get it all squared away. I 
have attached to this memo a "charter" which explains exactly what they 
are to do and lists the specific people assigned to do it. Anyone who 
can help these guys are requested to do so - particularly with regard 
to those rendezvous radar thermal constraints. Those are really going 
to screw us, I'm afraid.
