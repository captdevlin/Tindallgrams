This note is to inform everyone that the AS-502 spacecraft computer  
program ropes will be made preciely the same as those for AS-501.  
Specifically, it is MIT assembly Solarium 55. You recall Solarium 54  
was our original AS-501 A-release, but it was necessary to make a  
modification in one of the rope modules to correct a scaling problem.

Cline Frasier was given the recommendation to direct Raytheon in accordance  
with this on January 6, and it is my understanding that he intended  
to have Raytheon begin rope manufacture for AS-502 immediately. He informed  
me that the manufacture of the AS-501 ropes will be completed by  
about January 12th.
