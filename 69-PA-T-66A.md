As a result of some stirring aroudn within NASA on how the various
guidance and control systems are used during descent, George Cherry
of MIT took it upon himself to write a complete description of the
capabilities that exist and how they may be used. Without doubt,
_this is the finest, briefest,_ most readable description I have ever
seen on this subject and for that reason I am forwarding a copy to
you under this shining white piece of paper.

Gentlemen:

Malcolm Johnston has passed on to me the letters from Maj. General John
D. Stevenson to Mr. Donald K. Slayton and Mr. George M. Low, the letter from
George Low to General Stevenson, and your inquiry concerning a description of
lunar landing guidance and control modes, their testing at MIT, and our
version of their mission usefulness.

The letter from George Low to General Stevenson is quite a good description
of the guidance and control modes available for lunar landing. I believe
I can add a little detail concerning mode descriptions and their usefulness,
however. I have talked to some of the folks here and at MSC (principally
Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Donald Choetham, Warren North, etc.) about the
mission usefulness of the various guidance and control modes and, of course,
I am familiar with the testing we will perform on these modes. So here goes
our answer to your questions.

# P63

_Program 63,_ the Braking Phase Program Mode, _slows down the LM and guides
it to hi-gate._ The hi-gate target is arranged relative to the initial landing
site so that the guidance program's solution to the two-point boundary valued
problem between hi-gate and lo-gate tips the LM up _and allows the astronaut
to view the site._

The astronaut can display the PGNCS total guidance error on the
FDAI error needles (ATTITUDE MON switch in PGNCS) by having keyed in
V62 through the DSKY. He can then steer out the PGNCS P63 attitude errors
with the AGS (GUID CONT in AGS and AGS MODE CONTROL in ATT HOLD) manually
(ACA) or with the PGNCS manually 9GUID CONT In PGNCS and PGNCS MODE CONTROL
in ATT HOLD) or automatically (PGNCS MODE CONTROL in AUTO).

Note, then, that there are three attitude control submodes in P63:
AGS manual or PGNCS manual or PGNCS auto. This is true for P63, P64, and
P65. So I will not repeat this for P64 and P65. One word of caution,
however, if the astronaut hits the ROD (rate-of-descent) switch while he
is in PGNCS ATT HOLD, the LGC will irrevocably transfer him out of the auto
guidance program modes into the ROD program mode, P66.

Major program mode P63 is not just useful; it is essential. It is
useful, of course, to be able to [unreadable] out the PGNCS guidance errors
with the AGS ATT HOLD mode or the PGNCS ATT HOLD mode in order to assess the
handling qualities of the AGS analog autopilot. We cannot test at MIT,
the AGS steering because we do not simulate the AGS on our hybrid simulator.

In major mode P63, P64, P65, or P66 the control of the throttle should
be automatic. Thus, the astronaut can assume the attitude control function
with the AGS or PGNCS ATT HOLD modes in these major modes but he should
let the LGC control the throttle. Indeed, Neil Armostrong has told me that this
help from the LGC is very much appreciated and that simultaneous control
of attitude (and horizontal velocity) and throttle (descent rate) is a formidably
difficult crew task.

# P64

Program 64, the Approach or Visibility Phase major mode should result
in a LM thrusting attitude which permits astronaut line-of-sight out the LM
window through the LPD to the landing site. During mot of this phase
(after the astronaut has responded to the flashing DSKY request to arm the
SITE REDESIGNATION routine until about 20 seconds before the end of the
phase) the astronaut can use the ACA to redesignate the landing site. It
is worth noting that the PGNCS MODE CONTROL switch must be in AUTO for
the ACA to function as a landing site re-designator. If this switch is in
ATT HOLD the ACA functions as a rate command / attitude hold stick.

I think that the ATT HOLD sub-mode in P64 is very useful for it permits
the astronaut to assess the handling qualities of the LM with the current
status of the RCS jets (failed or unfailed) and the lower inertias encountered
after the braking phase. In fact, after his final use of the ACA in conjunction
with the LPD as a site re-designation device I would anticipate that he would
switch from AUTO to ATT HOLD for good and control the attitude of the spacecraft
manually while the LGC controls the throttle automatically with P64 and P65,
until he wants a different descent rate from the automatic one and operates
the ROD switch to select P66.

Incidentally, a good chance for the crew to assess the handling
qualities of the LM is at the junction between P63 and P64 when the
automatic guidance system commands about a (nominally) ten degree thrust
attitude change (V62 must have been entered to see the total change at
once). This maneuver, if done manually, gives the LM commander a chance
to maneuver the spacecraft according to the FDAI needles through
a fairly large change and feel the response.

# P65

Proram 64, the Automatic Terminal Landing Phase major mode, has the
guidance and control objectives of nulling the horizontal components of
velocity, establishing a descent rate of about 3 ft/sec, and achieving
an erect orientation of the LM. To use this mode completely automatically
the astronaut must leave both the MODE CONTROL switch and the throttle
control (THR CONT switch) in AUTO. But, of course, he can fly the PGNCS
FDAI error needles manually while P65 handles the throttle. This mode
seems very useful if the astronaut does not have good visibility out the
window but can believe the landing radar and trust the PGNCS. Notice that
there is no positional control in P65. The spacecraft simple settles down
from about 150 feet LGC attitude at about 3 ft/sec while nulling the horizontal
velocity until lunar contact is made. The automatic throttle to control descent
rate to 3 ft/sec may be particularly useful here if the LGC estimate of descent
rate is reasonably accurate. The attitude control by the astronaut could be
based on the PGNCS guidance errors on the FDAI error needles or by a combination
of eight ball and out the window cues. Thus, P65 can be looked at as a
P66 (with only one descent rate, 3 ft/sec) and FDAI error needle cues as
to how to null the horizontal velocity components and get the spacecraft
erect. This represents somewhat of an over-simplification of the dynamical
differences between P65 and P66 because P66 has one-half the guidance
sample and DSKY display period (once per second) that P65 has (once per two
seconds). Furthermore, the control law time constants for nulling
the descent velocity error are quite different in the two programs. The vertical
thrust acceleration commanded every two seconds in P65
is <nobr>A<sub>vert</sub> = (h<sub>d</sub> - h) / 10 + g</nobr> (P65) 
and the vertical acceleration commanded every one second in P66
is <nobr>A<sub>vert</sub> = (h<sub>d</sub> - h) / 1.5 + g</nobr> (P66). 
It can be seen that P66 will eliminate the
descent error faster than P65. The reason for the longer time constant in P64
is that both the throttle command and the attitude commands are generated from
the same equation in P65, to 
wit <nobr><u>a</u><sub>tc</sub> = (<u>V</u><sub>d</sub> - <u>V</u><sub>meas</sub>)/10 - <u>g</u></nobr>, (P65).

The thrust vector is commanded along <nobr><u>a</u><sub>tc</sub></nobr> and the throttle is set to
make the thrust acceleration equal to the magnitude of <nobr><u>a</u><sub>tc</sub></nobr>. A longer time
constant is needed to stabilize the attitude commands which are generated from <nobr><u>a</u><sub>tc</sub></nobr>.
(Incidentally, both the number 10 in P65 and the number 1.5 in P66 are
erasable quantities. These values are our best present estimates of what
these quantities should be). The longer time constant in P65 should be
acceptable since the descent rate at the beginning of P65 is nominally 3 ft/sec
(lo-gate) and there is very little descent rate error to null. Notice that
there will be a difference in reaction of the two control laws to landing
radar noise. P66 will be more reactive.

While mentioning radar noise, I ought to remind you that P65, P66, and
P67 all have the capability of establishing new landing radar velocity
weighting factors. We are presently using 0.1. We are doing fairly extensive
testing of P65 in the completely automatic mode on our all-digital simulator.
We will do some testing in the ATT HOLD Mode on our hybrid. I hope that
the crew will evaluate the usefullness and handling qualities of this mode.
I do believe that they ought to give it strong consideration because it
only has one strong competitor, P66.

# P66

Program 66, the rate-of-descent terminal phase major mode, requires
manual attitude control but provides automatic control of descent rate by
LGC control of the throttle. The astronaut can command changes in the descent
rate by 1 ft/sec incrementing or decrementing inputs from the rate-of-descent
switch. (The 1 ft/sec is actually a quantity in erasable storage.) This
mode can be entered from P63, P64, or P65 by putting the MODE CONTROL switch
in ATT HOLD and operating the ROD switch in one direction at least once.
This mode is not designed for large velocities, however, or long ranges
from the landing site and it is expected that it will be entered from P64
at about five-hundred feet altitude or later.

This appears to be the leading contender for the touch-down program
and we have put ag reat deal of engineering and testing into this program.
For example in regard to engineering improvements, Craig Schulenberg has
increased the frequency of the control loop to once per second, reduced
the computation lag, improved the throttle compensation, and speeded up the
DSKY displays. I believe that the LM pilot calls out the descent rate
he reads on the DSKY to the LM commander. This display will now have a
higher frequency and greater freshness. P66 receives a great deal of
testing emphasis at MIT.

# P67

Program 67, the completely automatic landing mode does not appear
to be very useful as a lunar landing touch-down mode but it may have other
uses. Crew members have told me that it is really a formidable task to
land with manual throttle and manual attitude control. The throttle
in particular appears to be hard to handle manually. We do not give this
landing mode much emphasis at MIT except to show that it works. We do not
do man-in-the-loop type landings to any extent with P67. I would not
anticipate that the crew would train on landing with P67.

I do see one possible use of P67 during landing, however. If the crew
wants to abort, they might want to switch to P67 first in order to erect
the vehicle's attitude and throttle up the DPS. He must throw the THR
CONT switch to MAN in order to obtain P67, however, and then throw the MODE
CONTROL switch to ATT HOLD in order to obtain manual control of the DAP.
This seems to gain little over just throttling up (the manual throttle overrides
the auto throttle when it is at a higher value no matter where THR
CON is) in P63, P64, and P65 with the MODE CONTROL switch in ATT HOLD.

Incidentally, the only thing I might think of taking exception to in the
enclosure to George Low's letter is the statement that the "AGS provides a
rate command attitude hold mode... that will provide essentially equal handling
qualities to that of the equivalent PGNCS mode." I would like to point out
that on the basis of IMS and MIT/IL tests we have engineered with the Flight
Crew Support Division an ACA quadratic stick that pleases the crew with
its handling qualities and reduces the RCS jet activity and DPS plume
impingement during hover. I do not believe the AGS autopilot has this kind
of rate command system. There may be other dynamical and handling qualities
differences between the two systems.

Extensive testing will be made n the DAP manual modes at the hover
inertia configuration of the DPS.
