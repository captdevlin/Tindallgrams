I always start out these MIT newsletters with the hope they will be short  
enough that you'll be willing to read 'em. A couple of things came up at  
our Program Development Plan review on November 16 there that I thought I  
would pass on.

1. It's becoming more and more obvious that the program development  
facilities at MIT - both digital and hybrid - are going to be severely  
saturated during the first 3 or 4 months of next year. During that period  
we will be working simultaneously on the AS-206, 207, 208, 503 CM and two  
504 programs, and we certainly will not have the second hybrid on the line.  
And s all this work will be dropped on the two 1800 digitals and the single  
hybrid facility until the IBM 360 digital computer is made operational.  
Since I am convinced the 360 readiness will not come early, I have asked  
MIT to set up a special task force specifically to keep the development of  
that facility progressing at the greastest possible speed. In addition we  
propose to help as much as we can by doing such things as preparing programs  
here at MSC for use in checking out the vital MAC compiler being  
developed by one of their contractors.

2. It is my understanding that all AC effort on program development  
being carried out at Milwaukee shall be terminated upon delivery of the  
AS-501 documentation which is scheduled for delivery on about December 5.  
The nine AC people who were sent to MIT for work on AS-501 are all being  
retained and are now working on AS-206.

3. It looks like we will be able to have a meaningful computer storage  
review in January. Ed Copps pointed out it is not only lack of storage  
that's going to trouble us, but also other things like the limit to the number  
of verbs and nouns, whatever they are, that are available.

4. Rick Nobles and his guys struck a vein of gold the other day up  
at MIT in the form of detailed flow charts of some parts of the program.  
These flow charts are the form of documentation everyone felt in their  
bones must be available somewhere 'cause you just can't program without  
something more definitive than the GSOP. Now that we have discovered them,  
MIY has agreed to let us use them with the understanding that they are not  
controlled documents and that MIT retains no responsibility for their  
accuracy and quality. We are delighted to accept the flow charts under  
those terms and will be responsible for reproducing and distributing them  
to whoever has need to know. I would like to reiterate that we have always  
maintained that the MIT documentation is inadequate, particularly  
in the area of flow charts and I have every intention of emphasizing that  
battle as soon as we get our program development plans in shape.

5. Some weeks ago we discussed the possibility of having several  
MSC people associated with flight crew working in residence at MIT with  
Jim Nevins' merry band on the development of Chapter 4 of the GSOP and  
associated crew procedures. Our objective was twofold - to speed up completion  
of that work for AS-502 as well as training these people to service  
the flight crews in their training for these tough Block II missions. MIT  
is still anxious to have these people come, but I understand from a brief  
discussion with Joe Loftus, who is handling this matter at MSC, that he has  
run into some problems. I certainly hope he is able to overcome these soon  
because it sure looked like a good idea to make MSC as independent as possible  
of MIT in the training of flight crews.

6. It lloks like our biggest schedule problem will be delivery of  
the AS-207/208 programs. Altrhough we have been meeting our AS-278 milestones  
with regard to GSOP delivery and program coding pretty well, MIT has recently  
revised their estimate of how long it takes to perform program integration  
and verification. It seems to me that the only way to improve the delivery  
schedule is to get the facilities MIT needs as soon as possible, as noted  
above, and to reduce the amount of work that is required. We are pursuing  
the idea of establishing processor priority lists both here and at MIT with  
the intent of carrying along all of them (including those unique for AS-503)  
in the AS-278 program assemblies, but givin gmaximum emphasis on the debugging  
and integration to those with the higher priority. For example, it's  
evident that it is not necessary to have th eentire concentric rendezvous  
flight plan operating to perform the AS-278 mission, since the maneuvers in  
those re-rendezvous mission phases will be established pre-flight and/or by  
ground control a la Gemini with the need for onboard maneuver determination  
starting only at TPI. I'm sure there are a number of other processors which  
could also be labeled not mandatory for the mission. It is our intention to  
see just how far we can back off in an effort to help the schedule. It is  
rather depressing that we have to take steps like this, but the advantage of  
this approach is that if the program integration proceeds faster than anticipated,  
or if more time becomes available for one reason or another, it will  
only be necessary to start working on processors which are already in the  
assembly, which is a much easier thing to do than to add them in when a reprieve  
occurs. And of course it gives us the option of accepting delivery of  
a flight program in which some of the lower priority processors are not working  
in order to obtain it sooner.

Wasn't very short was it, or interesting either, but I'll be darned if I'll  
throw it away after getting it to this stage.
