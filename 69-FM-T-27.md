Christopher C. Kraft had a Joint Program Development Plan meeting at
MIT on February 12. I would just like to pass on to you a couple of
things that were interesting to me.

1. Fred Martin stated that there are _90 separate changes_ being
made to the COLOSSUS 1A program in developing COLOSSUS 2. Altogether
this involves a change of about 2,000 to 2,500 lines of code of which
about 800 are the CSI/CDH addition and about 600 involve improvement to
the TVC DAP. COLOSSUS 2 was released for rope manufacture on Febrary 11.
This release is called Comanche Revision 44.

2. COLOSSUS 2A will use Comanche 44 as its starting base line for
the program which they plan for use in the G mission. Candidate program
changes suggested by MIT to be included in COLOSSUS 2A are as follows:

  a. New ephemeris and stars
  b. V82 time input
  c. Backup Mark Button
  d. Provide countdown to .05 g in P61
  e. Better definition of local vertical near sphere of influence where current formulation tends to break down.
  f. Add PTC and Orbit Rate modes into DAP via extended verb.
  g. Integrated stick during launch
  h. V35 light test (?)
  i. Lunar potential
  j. P64 G maximum display
  k. P34/35 speed up
  l. Asteer

3. George Cherry also suggested a list of candidates of LUMINARY
changes for post-G mission. They included:

  a. Changes to the rendezvous braking phase to provide display
  of raw rendezvous radar data and line-of-sight rates as well as
  providing some automatic line-of-sight attitude control.

  b. Some rendezvous navigation improvements including updating
  W-matrix through maneuvers.

  c. An improvement to the alignment programs to make it more
  convenient for the crew to align the LM IMU to the CSM IMU.

  d. Explicit descent abort variable insertion targeting.

In general, spacecraft computer program development certainly seems to
be under control with very little frantic activity foreseen. Probably
the programs requiring the most attention now are associated with powered
descent to the moon. In fact, Mr. Kraft had MIT give an informal briefing
lasting about two hours in which they presented their opinion of how the
descent targeting should be done. I gather it is in close agreement with
things Floyd Bennett's people have been recommending.
