During the January 11 program development meeting at MIT, a couple 
of things came up regarding the AS-206 program that are probably worth 
recording here.

The most significant one, affecting date of the program release, involves 
verification testing. MIT has laid out a complete test plan of about 46 
runs. It was their strong recommendation that if time permits, i.e., if 
other factors are delaying the flight sufficiently, they should carry 
out the entire test plan. This would flight qualify the program not only 
for the nominal mission, contingency orbit insertion and launch aborts, 
but also would verify the system's capacity for tolerating spacecraft 
systems failures such as RCS jets or computer interrupts, etc. They felt 
they could do the whole business by February 15, going into configuration 
control about the 1st of February. Alternatively, MIT and MSC people 
have identified nine computer runs which the program must execute successfully 
before we would be willing to use it in flight. These mandatory 
tests could be carried out within the previously stated schedule with a 
release on about January 30. The Apollo Spacecraft Program Manager gave 
permission to slip release of the flight program to do the more complete 
job in accordance with our recommendation to do so on January 12.

You will recall our agreement with Grumman to release a program tape to 
them whenever they felt the program and their facility was ready. It is 
my understanding that we are making the first of these program releases 
on about January 18 along with sufficient typical test runs and verbal 
instructions to permit Grumman to make the most of it. Since early December, 
Grumman has assigned one of their better people, Clint Tillman, to 
duty at MIT for about two or three days each week. This arrangement seems 
to have worked out very well from everyone's viewpoint, I'm very pleased 
to report.

The AS-206 operational trajectory has just come out and apparently is 
based on four-second ullage. Since this indicated there is some confusion, 
Tommy Gibson and I thought it might be worthwhile to reiterate here 
that the spacecraft computer program is being designed with thirteen-second 
ullage as previously reported. This duration was selected, you 
recall, to provide adequate ullage in the event only two jets are active. 
It was our way of protecting against RCS jet failures without providing 
logic for changing ullage time in that event.

We have experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining from the 
Engineering and Development Directorate the necessary propulsion system 
data needed to complete the formulation of the spacecraft computer programs. 
Response by that organization has been completely unacceptable. 
I suspect this is partially due to the rather informal manner in which 
this data was requested. It is obvious that we cannot continue to 
operate this way, and so in the future requests for this information will 
be made on a much more formal basis - smothered in the usual stack of 
paperwork, signed by the necessary managers around here. It is evident 
that if we fail to deliver this data on schedule to MIT, slips in the 
delivery of the flight programs will be charged to us - and with some 
justification. 

You remember the business we went through some months ago regarding the 
attitude hold mode to be programmed in the LGC for use during separation 
of the LN from the SIVB. Without going through all that history, it is 
probably sufficient to report that MIT has finally concluded they can 
develop a better program providing inertial attitude hold rather than the 
attitude rate hold I previously reported would be programmed.

For whatever it's worth, I might summarize my impression of AS-206 program 
quality. In spite of considerable difficulty in pulling this program 
together at MIT, Jim Miller and Dan Lickly have done a commendable professional 
job, and I really expect this program to perform very well for us. 
Considerable credit is also due Tom Gibson, Carl Huss and a number of 
others in providing the necessary coordination and input from MSC. I 
don't know why I'm sticking my neck out on a prediction like that. Just 
living dangerously, I guess.
