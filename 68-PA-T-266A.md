In response to a C' Mission Techniques action item, Rick Nobles 
informs me that they have established the burn monitoring procedure 
to guard against overburn during an non-nominal C' maneuver. As a 
standard procedure the crew should manually shut down the SPS as soon 
as the duration of the burn exceeds the nominal value by one percent 
and the EMS dV Counter indicates an overburn of one percent over its 
nominal reading. The nominal value of burn time and dV Counter 
reading are included in the PAD messages and block data relayed from 
the MCC-H for all abort maneuvers. (Current Mission Techniques 
Documentation reflects this procedure.) It is to be emphasized that 
this overburn monitoring procedure is only for the non-nominal maneuvers 
and does not apply to TLI, LOI, and TEI for which specific techniques 
have been developed.
