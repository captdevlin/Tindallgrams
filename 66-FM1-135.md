The other day at MIT, when we were discussing the alternate mission
AS-278B, the question came up of how the astronaut assures himself that 
the contents of the erasable memory is as it should be when he first 
powers-up the computer in space. Since there seemed to be some confusion 
or uncertainty at MIT, I suppose that situation is the same throughout 
the universe. We were told, or at least I think we were told, that 
when first turning on the computer after it has been completely powered-down
there is no assurance that the contents of the erasable memory will 
be the same as it was when powered-down. Since on _every_ manned LM 
mission the computer must be brought on line from a completely dormant 
state, some procedure must be established for checking this portion of 
memory, I suppose. Is anyone within the sound of my voice working on 
that? In fact, who is supposed to? I guess we ought to ask MIT to do 
something, and we will.
