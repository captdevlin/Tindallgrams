If they ever have a contest to select the piece of Apollo with the 
funniest history, I would like to enter "computer self check". It 
came up again at the MIT review on January 12 as a possible candidate 
for deletion. One of the MIT guys gave a long, convincing 
argument in its defense, and although MIT pointed out that approximately 
two-thirds of the program are not mandatory for flight, they 
certainly gave the impression it was highly desirable. It was only 
the next day we found out the actual MIT position was a recommendation 
to delete most of the self check program, and they were disappointed 
that we had not done so. Weird.

Something else just happened I think you will find amusing. You 
remember troubles were discovered in the AS-202 self check program 
and it was deactivated before the flight to prevent it from screwing 
up the system. Well, I hear the same thing has happened on the 
AS-204 program. I guess we should be happy they discover these problems 
before the flights instead on during them. Apparently if the 
system was left as it is now, it has the potential of bombing out 
the system irrecoverably. I assume, or at least hope, that if it did 
that, it would light the little red light.
