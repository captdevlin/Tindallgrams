I think this will amuse you. It's something that came up the other
day during a Descent Abort Mission Techniques meeting.

As you know, there is a light on the LM dashboard that comes on when
there is about two minutes worth of propellant remaining in the DPS
tanks with the engine operating at quarter thrust.  This is to give
the crew an indication of how much time they have left to perform the
landing or to abort out of there.  It compliments the propellant gauges.
The present LM weight and descent trajectory is such that this light
will always come on prior to touch down.  This signal, it turns out,
is connected to the master alarm - how about that!  In other words,
just at the most critical time in the most critical operation of a
perfectly nominal lunar landing mission, the master alarm with all
its lights, bells, and whistles will go off.  This sounds right lousy
to me.  In fact, Pete Conrad tells me he labeled it completely unacceptable
four or five years ago, but he was probably just an Ensign at the time
and apparently no one paid any attention.  If this is not fixed, I predict
the first words uttered by the first astronaut to land on the moon will be
"Gee whiz, that master alarm certainly startled me."

As I understand it, cutting the wire to the master alarm eliminates the
low level sensor light too.  If nothing else can be done, this should be
and we'll get along just using the propellant gauges without the light.
If possible, a better fix would be to cut the wire on both sides of
the master alarm and jumper the signal to the light only.

Incidentally, on the D mission the propellent  levels will be low enough
when we get to the DPS rendezvous maneuvers - Phasing and Insertion - that
if this system is activated prior to ullage, the master alarm will likely
go off.  I guess it will be standard procedure to punch it off if that
happens.  But, where this is just an annoyance on D, it is dangerous on G.
