subject: Justification for SCAMA circuit to MIT/Boston
---

This memorandum is to provide justification for the addition of a SCAMA
circuit between Houston and MIT/Boston and two additional telephones in
Building 30, MSC.

The Flight Control Division has established a requirement that consultative 
services by knowledgable MIT personnel be readibly available during 
Apollo flight operations. Since the impact on future computer program 
development of extended tours of duty at Mission Control Center-Houston 
by key MIT personnel is unacceptable, an alternate approach has been 
proposed by MFAD and accepted by FCD. This approach is for Flight Software 
Branch personnel to provide this service in the Mission Control 
Center-Houston with immediate access by special communication circuits 
to the aforementioned MIT people at their disposal. Discussion with 
personnel of your Division have led to the conclusion that a special 
SCAMA circuit between MSC and MIT/Boston is most suitable and economical 
for this purpose. This circuit shoudl be terminated at the 
MIT switchboard in Boston. Access to it must be available in the Flight 
Dynamics Staff Support Room of Building 30, MSC.

The need for rapid and convenient communications between those persons 
at MSC responsible for technical direction of MIT in the area of spacecraft 
computer programming has been long recognized. Present communications 
are of poor quality and often result in significant delays in the 
relay of important information. It is estimated that in the order of 
200 telephone calls per month have been made over the last several months, 
and it is anticipated that the frequency is likely to increase. It is 
evident that addition of a SCAMA phone providing access to the mission 
support circuit requested above will not only improve communication but 
should result in a significant savings to the government by its absorption 
of telephone calls which are otherwise carried out on commercial 
and FTS circuits. This instrument should be located in the offices of 
the Flight Software Branch on the second floor of Building 30.

Since the AS-204 simulations and actual operation are imminent, and since 
the non-operational need is continuing, it is requested that these additional 
facilities be provided as soon as possible. If further assistance 
is required in establishing our needs in more detail, please contact 
either Stan Mann (Flight Software Branch) or myself.
