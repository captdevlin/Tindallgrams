The attached memorandum lists all of the program changes required to the  
AS-202 program to fly AS-501 and AS-502. As you can see, there are quite  
a few, although most are quite simple. For example, some of these changes  
are merely corrections to bugs that were known to be in the AS-202 program  
when we flew it. We made a strong effort to minimize the changes, and it's  
my impression that all of these are really required with the possible exception  
of a couple that were put in to provide for the flexibility we felt might  
be needed to make the program usable for the AS-502 mission which was not  
then completely defined.

As you recall, certain mission changes were required which took some time  
to negotiate, both here at MSC and at Marshall. Carl Huss, from our division,  
deserves a lot of credit for his work in getting these missions revised and  
thus minimizing the program changes required. (By the way, Carl is writing  
a note to explain the differences in the AS-501 and AS-502 missions in response  
to the question you penciled onto one of my memos). We know of no  
reason at this time why the AS-501 program will not do the AS-502 job. Some  
program verification may be required to check such things as the differences  
in the targeting, but it is our intention to keep this to an absolute minimum.

This program has gone together very nicely. Dan Likely and his team of AC  
and MIT people are to be commended for the professional manner in which  
they handled this job. The program was frozen October 11th - one day behind  
schedule. It completed test verification and was released to Raytheon for  
rope manufacture October 24th - on schedule. This program has no known bugs  
or deficiencies at this time. If development of all the AGC programs went  
like this, we'd be out of a job.
