Here is another Mission Techniques Documentatin Schedule, since the
last one is three months old and barely reflects real life any more.
The Lunar Orbit Activities Document will almost certainly have to be
updated to reflect whatever we learn on the F mission. A June 30
release date for that update will be kinda late, of course, but that
is a problem everyone has when the launch occurs seven weeks after
the last splashdown.
