subject: In which some items of interest regarding the AS-206 LGC program status are discussed
---
Quite a number of things have been going on with regard to AS-206 mission  
plans, spacecraft configuration, and the LGC computer program development.  
I would like to take a couple of minutes here to let you know about the  
latest developments in the latter.

Ed Copps indicates that the program development is proceeding on schedule  
as far as he can tell, and that the next valid schedule check-point will  
occur in about three weeks. I suppose we will schedule a review about  
that time. MIT has been studying the effects of the spacecraft equipment  
deletions on the program and to date has found nothing that is not acceptable.  
They did point out that it is necessary for the ground to send  
certain commands which previously were optional. We did not take time to  
examine this particular subject in detail, but I would suggest that someone  
from the Flight Control Division should get in touch with Tom Price  
of our Flight Software Branch to learn more about this in detail.

One program change requested by ASPO was for the LGC to issue some additional  
commands in order that redundant relays could be used in two mission  
critical circuits. MIT indicated that this program change could be implemented  
without schedule impact since we had already indicated to them that  
it would be okay to delete several processrs from the AS-206 program  
which were no longer required. Specifically, we dropped out the 3rd and  
4th APS maneuvers and the RCS cold soak since they are no longer a part of  
the mission. We also indicated that we could probably omit the DPS cold  
soak phase from the mission if that provided a significant saving in program  
effort or, if it permitted, the use of a more desirable platform alignment.  
Apparently the alignment which has been chosen for the AS-206 has been somewhat  
constrained by this cold soak phase and makes necessary special prelaunch  
processing of some sort. MIT is to let us know if dropping this  
mission phase would be beneficial to them.

Currently there are no open items on the AS-206 program, although MIT is  
concerned about a couple of things. One is they are not happy about our  
one-second downlink. They feel that this will not provide enough data  
for post-flight analysis and are concerned that MSC will soon request additional  
downlink formats. The second item is associated with the LM spacecraft  
separation from the Saturn. Apparently we have requested that a  
constant attitude rate be maintained as opposed to an inertial attitude  
hold which would be simpler to provide. I gather they just honestly don't  
understand why anyone wants this constant rate mode, although they are  
programming it. Carl Huss was going to look into this a little bit.  
Apparently he was not even aware that was the way it was to be. Weird.  

Two items were closed out as follows:

a) We have instructed MIT to implement 4-jet ullage in the AS-206  
program; i.e., the computer program will command all 4 jets on for the  
duration of time which would be required if only 2 jets were used. This  
is to insure that the ullage will be sufficient for the main engine start  
in spite of jet failures which have been protected against by the jet select  
logic in the program. Implementing the 4-jet logic means there is no need  
for the dV monitor nor the changes to the spacecraft jet failure systems  
which had been suggested. The dV monitor, you recall, was a proposed program  
change [i.e., MDRB #206-19] which was to inhibit the main engine start  
signal if sufficient dV had not been detected by the LGC.

b) MIT was informed to change the DPS engine start sequence to 10%  
thrust rather than 30% thrust. This change is beneficial to program development  
and to the engine people - a rare occurence.

I might also point out we had a highly successful meeting with Grumman on  
October 20th where we discussed their requirements for program tapes and  
data packages for use on their simulation facilities. As I understand it,  
everyone agreed that we could provide tapes at any time Grumman requested  
them with the understanding that they would certainly not be flight qualified  
- in fact, their quality will likely be unknown at the time of delivery.  
We also indicated that the deficiency reports accompanying these  
tapes might be rather crude and incomplete. As a possible work around, it  
was suggested that Grumman could provide a knowledgeable resident at MIT  
for the last couple of weeks prior to their acquiring a tape. This person  
should the be aware of the status of the program when they get it.  
Actually, Grumman has taken steps to do this - two of their guys were up  
there just last week to get their feet wet.
