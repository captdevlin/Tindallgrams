Gene Kranz brought the attached G mission LUMINARY Anomaly Report
to my attention. I have no idea how he happened to find it amongst
all the more [unintelligible] ones. No one else seemed particularly
aware or concerned about it, but I wanted to bring it to your attention.

I have asked MIT to [unintelliglble] procedures definitively
[unintelligible] for delay in the [unintelligible].

# MIT/IL SOFTWARE ANOMALY REPORT

Program: LUMINARY

Program Revision: 07

1.1 Originator: C. Schulenberg

1.2 Organization: MIT/IL

1.3 Date: 4/28/69

1.5 Description of anomaly: If a *hardware _or_ software (either type!)* restart occurs in P63 between the nominal ignition time and the time of FTP, 
the LGC will fail to throttle the DPS to maximum thrust and the landing guidance
equations will not be put into operation.

1.6 [Heading unclear]: Anomaly pointed out in TRW memo, entitled, Questionable Items in LUMINARY 07
Listing (A-201, 4/28/69)

## MIT ANALYSIS

2.1 Root Cause: Programmer Error.

2.2 [Heading unclear]: See Sector 1.5

2.3 Mission Impact: If the recovery procedure is not taken in a timely manner, the landing woudl have
to be aborted via selection of P70 or P71.

2.4 Avoidance Procedure: None

2.5 Recovery Procedure: Force DPS to maximum thrust via manual throttle at FTP time. Then key in
V24N01E01252E02162E. Then wait a few seconds and reduce manual
throttle to 10 percent.

2.6 Program Correction: Correct restart protection for P63 throttle-up task.

2.7 Recommended Disposition [uncler]: Fix program or be prepared to use recovery procedure depending on the likelihood
of a restart in this time interval.

2.8 Recommended Re-Testing: Restart test of P63.
