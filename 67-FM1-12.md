subject: Why does the AAP command module need a sextant?
---
Use of horizon scanners for AAP earth orbital missions would considerably 
reduce the crew's workload and would eliminate the operational
constraint of only being able to orient the platform when the spacecraft 
is in darkness. I realize the use of horizon scanners has already been 
suggested and is being investigated.

The reason for this note is to point out that if we put a radar on the 
AAP command module to take care of rendezvous and put horizon scanners 
on to line up the platform, I really can't think of any reason why we 
need that sextant any more. Of course, I haven't thought much about 
it, but it seems to me there might be a considerable saving of weight 
to go that way as well as making the spacecraft a heck of a lot better 
for general purpose, earth orbital missions.
