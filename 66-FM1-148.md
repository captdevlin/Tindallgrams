I guess enough things have happened affecting the status of the programs  
for the AS-278 mission that I ought to issue another status report.  
According to MIT, work is progressing along basically on schedule. The   
major effort is currently in Ed Copps' area where coding of the program  
is going on which should be completed early in December. At that time all  
of the basic components of the program will have been compiled into a  
single working assembly. It is this assembly which Alex Kosmala's Program  
Integration Group puts through systematic debugging and then finally, when  
all of the systems are working together, through the final program verification.  
It is to be noted that this work is done with an assembly made up  
of the entire flight program - it is not broken down into subsections  
which are later assembled together. Of course, during the initial stages  
of this program integration the major task is to get the subroutines,  
which have been individually debugged and are running in this master assembly,  
to work with each other. That is, the task is to get these individual  
processors to run in sequential strings - the output of one serving as the  
input to the next - with astronaut inputs and displays all working properly.

As of last week all MDRB's [i.e., program modifications] under consideration  
were acted upon. Specifically, it was agreed to add the so-called  
universal update in both the CMC and the LGC. This was the only modification  
to the CMC and resulted in slipping the program delivery date about  
one week. Other LGC MDRB's approved were a GASTA transformation which was  
required in order to provide DSKY displas consistent with the FDAI eight  
ball and addition of a minimum impulse mode for the APS.

The effect of these modifications was to delay LGC program delivery approximately  
a week and a half. Thus, our best current estimate of program  
delivery for the AS-207 program is April 28 and the AS-208 program is May 5.  
Of course, every effort will be made to improve this delivery schedule.

Since work is proceedin again on the orbit rate eight ball, I suppose  
there may be some special processor required to compute and display initialization  
quantities for that black box. Paul Stull is checking into that,  
as well as what spacecraft this would be needed for, if any.

MDRB's which were not approved for the AS-207 program were those providing  
the capability for AGC steering of the SIVB simulating transluner injection  
and manual takeover of the Saturn during launch into earth orbit. These  
two routines would have resulted in an additional four weeks' impact on  
the AS-207 delivery, which was judged unacceptable. However, since a  
test of the AGC-SIVB interface is considered mandatory prior to the lunar  
landing mission, we have had no choice but to provide a unique program  
for the AS-503 command module. You recall it was our desire to fly both  
the AS-278 and AS-503 missions with the same programs, but this apparently  
is not possible for schedule reasons for the CMC. The LM programs will be  
the same. Since there is very little difference in the launch schedule  
of the AS-278 and AS-503, we will have to maintain tight control on new programs  
to be added to the AS-207 program for AS-503.

As I see it right now, the additional programs consist of:

a) Simulation of the TLI steering of the SIVB.
b) Manual Saturn steering into earth orbit. (Holy waste-of-time, Batman!)
c) Use of star/horizon and star/landmark observations in the onboard  
   navigation process.
  
MIT has been directed to proceed as noted above and will assemble a program  
development plan for the AS-503 command module program. I assume  
that soonest possible delivery will be in the order of a month after  
AS-207 - say, May 26.
