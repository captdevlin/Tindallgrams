At one time I had sort of expected that we would have to maintain two basic programs for each Apollo spacecraft -  one for earth orbital operations and one for lunar operations. The former would probably be a refinement of the AS-258 programs and the latter of the AS-504 programs. Further investigation, primarily by Norm Sears of MIT, has revealed that it should be possible to develop spacecraft programs for the lunar mission which will also handle earth orbital missions of at least the AS-258 complexity. Accordingly, it is our intention to develp the AS-504 programs in this way for use on all main line Apollo flights after AS-503. They will be designed to even permit execution of alternate mission plans as a result of contingency situations occurring during the operation. That in, the earth orbital versus lunar option can be exercised in-flight as well as pre-flight.

This new capability provides a considerable flexibility as well as allowing us to exercise the lunar mission programs in earth orbit. Since it is somewhat of a departure from our original plan, I thought it would be worthwhile to tell you about it.
