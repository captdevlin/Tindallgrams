On June 14 we cranked up the "D" Rendezvous Mission Techniques
activities again.  It was a grueling profitable day.  In fact, we
had such a good time we've scheduled another one for July 12.

Prior to the meeting I distributed a list of working agreements I
thought we had reached previously.  The crew presented another list
dealing primarily with the docked LM activation/mini-football period
based on a lot of planning and simulations they have been doing lately.
The major part of the meeting was spent going through these lists.  I
have since compiled a new set derived from those - including the
changes, agreements, and comments the discussion brought about.  This
list is attached and we can review it July 12.  The last section lists
some major discussion items still open.  A list of action items is also
attached since they help to paint the picture of our current status,
which I would describe as being typically frantic.
