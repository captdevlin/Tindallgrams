1. A great many things were discussed and resolved at the July 22 
"D" Rendezvous Mission Techniques meeting. They will all be fully 
recorded in the minutes. There were three times, however, I would 
like to call particular attention to at this time by this memo.

2. In order to avoid any chance of recontact as a result of maneuver 
dispersions in the CSM RCS seperation maneuver whcih starts off the 
"D" mission rendezvous, it was decided to increase its magnitude 
from 1.0 to 2.5 fps. It will still be performed in a radial direction. 
This was brought about when it was recognized that an error of about 
0.4 fps in the horizontal retrograde direction would result in 
recontact after the big phasing burn. Dispersions of that magnitude 
could easily occur due to imperfect velocity nulling during station 
keeping, G&N maneuver dispersions, spacecraft venting, etc.

3. It has been established that the elevation angle to be used by 
both spacecraft in determining all TPI times - nominal and contingency - 
will be 27.5.

4. The out-of-plane component of the TPI maneuvers shall be targeting to 
force a node at TPF rather than at the second midcourse correction 
maneuver. This will also apply to the lunar rendezvous mission, 
which the "D" was attempting to simulate in this respect. The change 
is being made to simplify the crew timeline and procedures; it is felt 
to be entirely adequate based on the recently adopted plans for handling 
out-of-plane on the lunar rendezvous.

5. The above decisions are considered firm and should be immediately 
incorporated in all aspects of the Apollo Program to which they apply. 
They will only be changed if there is a darned good reason - not just 
to make things a little better!
